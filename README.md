Creating a food recipe app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves building a user-friendly interface where users can view, search, and save recipes. Here's a breakdown of the features and structure for the app:

Key Features
Home Page:

•Displays a list of recipes.
•Includes a search bar for finding recipes by name or ingredient.
Recipe Details Page:

•Shows the ingredients and step-by-step instructions for a selected recipe.
•Option to save favorite recipes.
Add Recipe Form:

•Allows users to add their own recipes with fields for name, ingredients, and instructions.
Favorites Section:

•Users can view recipes they've marked as favorites.
Responsive Design:

•Ensures the app looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.


•Structure
HTML:

Provides the structure for pages (home, recipe details, form, etc.).
Uses semantic elements like <header>, <section>, <article>, and <footer>.
CSS:

Adds styling for layout, typography, colors, and animations.
Ensures responsiveness using Flexbox, Grid, or media queries.
JavaScript:

Handles interactivity (e.g., search functionality, saving favorites, toggling views).
Uses local storage to save recipes and user preferences.
Development Plan
Step 1: Create the basic HTML structure for pages.
Step 2: Style the app using CSS for an appealing and responsive design.
Step 3: Add JavaScript for functionality, such as recipe management and user interaction.
Step 4: Test and optimize for usability across devices.
